        My name is Kuba Michalski. I'm 16 and I live in Poland. I'm in technical school in Warsaw. In future, I'd like to be front-end developer. I love creating websites!<br>
        Few years ago I just realized, that Jesus has changed my life and I came up with a thought that I can tell you about it, becouse you may be in such a place in your life where you see, that there must be something more, or you just don't have any clue what is the sense of your life... Well, I don't know. But I know what is the sense of my life and that's why I write about it in the About section.
